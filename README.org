* flow-degen

This is a deserialization _generator_ for JavaScript objects that are under
[[http://flow.org][Flow]]. Some deserializer/validator projects use =$ObjMap= and some clever casting
to achieve a type safe means of deserialization/validation. =flow-degen= aims to
leverage Flow itself in ensuring type safety by _generating_ all of that ugly
deserialization/validation code you would have written by hand.

** installation

#+begin_src sh
yarn install -D flow-degen
#+end_src

** usage

Once installed, you can use the =flow-degen= script to generate your
deserializers:

#+begin_src sh
yarn flow-degen degen-config.json
#+end_src

** config structure

#+begin_src json
  {
    "importLocations": {
      "importName": "./dir/runtime.js"
    },
    "typeLocations": {
      "TypeName": "./dir/type.js"
    },
    "generators": [
      ["deserializer-output-file.js", "./dir/generator-input-file.js"]
    ]
  }
#+end_src

** bragging rights

The config object above is generated from =config-generator.js= which in turn
must deserialize itself in order to build the generator. =mind-blown.gif=
