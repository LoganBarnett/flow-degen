** 0.8.0
   + Use an exhaustive-union check to ensure your disjoint-union/sum types are
     checking for every member of the union.
   + When =JSON.stringify= receives a =mixed= it can be =undefined= as its
     output instead of =string=. The =stringify= utility has been added which
     will return the string ='undefined'= in the case of =undefined=.
   + Use =@flow strict= for generated files.
   + Add documentation for =degenSentinelValue=, =degenSum=, and =degenValue=.
   + (Hopefully) Fix a bug where the =deString= dependency from =degenEnum=
     wasn't being chained out of =degenSum=. The test framework is still being
     put together so this wasn't fully tested.
   + Introduced a changelog.
   + Internally, there is now an automated test for generation and checking for
     Flow errors.
   + Internally, source files now use the =@flow strict= annotation.
