** 0.9.0
*** Breaking
    + The new =generatedPreamble= field is required and will break
      configurations that lack it.
*** Additions
    + Added =generatedPreamble= to the configuration, which gets added to the
      top of generated files.
*** Fixes
    + Use =@flow strict= for generated files. =0.8.0= did not actually accomplish
      this.
    + Fix some type coverage in =deserializer.js= which is a runtime file.
** 0.8.0
*** Breaking
*** Additions
*** Fixes
    + Use an exhaustive-union check to ensure your disjoint-union/sum types are
      checking for every member of the union.
    + When =JSON.stringify= receives a =mixed= it can be =undefined= as its
      output instead of =string=. The =stringify= utility has been added which
      will return the string ='undefined'= in the case of =undefined=.
    + +Use =@flow strict= for generated files.+ Adding =@flow strict= did not
      happen in this release but instead in =0.9.0=.
    + Fix a bug where the =deString= dependency from =degenEnum= wasn't being
      chained out of =degenSum=. The test framework is still being put together
      so this wasn't fully tested.
*** Internal
    + Add documentation for =degenSentinelValue=, =degenSum=, and =degenValue=.
    + Introduced a changelog.
    + Internally, there is now an automated test for generation and checking for
      Flow errors.
    + Internally, source files now use the =@flow strict= annotation.
